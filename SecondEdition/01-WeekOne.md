# Cloud Fundamentals

## The 12-Week AWS Workshop Challenge with Pauline Namwakira
---------------------------------------------------------

This inaugural session, led by [Pauline Namwakira](https://paulinenamwakira.com/) from Nairobi, Kenya – an AWS Community Builder and AWS Technical Trainer – sets the foundation for everything that follows.

Pauline brings both the technical expertise and teaching experience to help you grasp the core concepts that underpin modern cloud computing.

Learning Through Questions
--------------------------

Rather than simply reading about cloud fundamentals, this article takes a different approach: _learning through questioning._

The questions below are designed to challenge your understanding, spark curiosity, and help you think critically about AWS concepts.

Whether you’re using this to test yourself after watching the session, preparing for the workshop, or solidifying your knowledge before writing your own blog post, these questions will reveal both what you know and where you need to dig deeper.

Try answering these questions in your own words before researching the answers, using the additional sources provided.

20 Essential Questions on AWS Cloud Fundamentals
------------------------------------------------

### Cloud Computing Foundations

**1.**  How would you explain cloud computing to someone who has never heard of it, using a real-world analogy?

**2.**  What specific problem does cloud computing solve that traditional on-premises infrastructure cannot address effectively?

**3.** If a company is currently running all their servers in their own data center, what are three compelling business reasons they should consider moving to the cloud?

### Cloud Deployment Models

**4.** What is the fundamental difference between public, private, and hybrid cloud deployments, and what factors would influence a company to choose one over the others?

**5.** Can you describe a realistic scenario where a hybrid cloud deployment model would be the optimal choice?

**6.** What is a community cloud, and how does it differ from the other deployment models?

### Benefits & Characteristics of Cloud Computing

**7.** AWS promotes six key advantages of cloud computing. Can you name at least four and explain why each matters from a business perspective?

**8.** What does “elasticity” mean in cloud computing, and how is it different from “scalability”?

**9.** How does the cloud’s “pay-as-you-go” pricing model change the way companies approach IT budgeting and financial planning?

**10.** Why is “high availability” considered a core characteristic of cloud computing, and what AWS features enable it?

### Cloud Service Models

**11.** What are the three primary cloud service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), and what level of control does a customer have in each?

**12.** If you need to deploy a web application but don’t want to manage the underlying operating system or servers, which service model would be most appropriate and why?

**13.** Can you provide an example of a SaaS application you use regularly, and explain why it’s classified as SaaS rather than PaaS or IaaS?

**14.** In the shared responsibility model, how do security responsibilities differ between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS from the customer’s perspective?

### AWS Global Infrastructure

**15.** What is the difference between an AWS Region, an Availability Zone, and an Edge Location?

**16.** Why would a company choose to deploy their application across multiple Availability Zones within a single Region?

**17.** When deciding which AWS Region to deploy your application in, what are the key factors you should consider?

**18.** How do AWS Edge Locations contribute to improving application performance for global users?

### AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

**19.** What is the principle of least privilege in IAM, and why is it critical for AWS security?

**20.** Can you explain the difference between an IAM user, an IAM group, an IAM role, and an IAM policy, and when you would use each?

### [Create An AWS Account](https://medium.com/@ntombizakhona/12-weeks-aws-workshops-challenge-267dbd668df3)

> Prerequisites
> 
> To create an AWS Account you will need:
> 
> (1) an administrative email account,
> 
> (2) and a valid payment method.
> 
> By administrative email account, I don’t mean a domain email account necessarily, just an email account that you have permanent access to, which belongs to you. This email account will come in handy when you need to recover your account or for certain administrative tasks.

### [Set Up An IAM User & MFA](https://medium.com/@ntombizakhona/12-weeks-aws-workshop-challenge-92ace09800a3)

> The Principle of Least Privilege is a practice whereby you only grant the user basic, minimum permissions based on their role, and the task that they need to do. It is a good idea, and best practice to use an IAM user for everyday tasks, instead of the Root User.
> 
> So we will create an IAM User, assign it a role, and enable Multi Factor Authentication.
> 
> Before we create an IAM User, I assume you already have an AWS Account that you access using the administrative Root User, if you don’t have an AWS Account, create one…

### [AWS Identity & Access Management (IAM) Workshops](https://workshops.aws/categories/AWS%20Identity%20&%20Access%20Management%20%28IAM%29)

> Least Privilege with IAM Access Analyzer
> 
> This workshop provides an overview of IAM then focuses on use cases to achieve Least Privilege with AWS Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer (IAM Access Analyzer).

### [AWS Whitepapers & Guides](https://aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/?whitepapers-main.sort-by=item.additionalFields.sortDate&whitepapers-main.sort-order=desc&awsf.whitepapers-content-type=*all&awsf.whitepapers-global-methodology=*all&awsf.whitepapers-tech-category=*all&awsf.whitepapers-industries=*all&awsf.whitepapers-business-category=*all)

> Expand your knowledge of the cloud with AWS technical content authored by AWS and the AWS community, including technical whitepapers, decision guides, technical guides, reference material, and reference architecture diagrams.
> 
> For an outline of the AWS Cloud and an introduction to the services available, see the Overview of Amazon Web Services.

### [Pauline Namwakira](https://paulinenamwakira.com/)

> As an AWS Authorized Instructor and Cloud Consultant, I’ve built a career empowering professionals and organizations through tailored cloud training and solutions.
> 
> Based in Nairobi, Kenya, I bring practical expertise in AWS services, Terraform, Python, and Bash to help clients navigate their cloud journeys.

Concluding Remarks
------------------

The true transformation in your AWS journey happens at the intersection of three practices: hands-on experimentation, targeted research, and community engagement.

Don’t just read about IAM policies – create them in the console, break them, and fix them.

When you encounter concepts you don’t fully grasp, dive into AWS documentation, whitepapers, and trusted blogs to build deeper understanding.

**…and most importantly: leverage the AWS Community to gain Cloud Skills!**

_The AWS community isn’t just a support system; it’s an accelerator that turns individual learning into collective wisdom, transforming your 12-week challenge from a solo journey into a collaborative expedition where everyone rises together._
