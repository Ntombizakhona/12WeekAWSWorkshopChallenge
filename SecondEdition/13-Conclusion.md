Tranforming A Challenge Into A Habit
====================================

The 12-Week AWS Workshop Challenge by Paula Wakabi
--------------------------------------------------

[**I’ve just built a _fully-stackish_ (full stack but basic front and back end) AWS Serverless Application… and possibly the longest blog post since the dawn of Cloud Computing.**](https://medium.com/capstone-project-architecture-review-38db82027d5f)

Honestly, I think the electrons in my keyboard need a support group.
But hey, it was worth it, I actually enjoyed it.

Because more importantly: **I did it.**

This was more than just another tech project. It was a **12-Week Immersion**, a **Certification Prep Strategy**, and unexpectedly, the start of a **New Habit** I plan to take into 2026 and beyond.

So this article isn’t a tutorial (I already wrote the novel-length one).
It’s a reflection on how the 12 Week AWS Challenge helped me **rethink how I learn**, **how I show up consistently**, and how I went from following along to _actually building cloud-native systems that make sense._

Transforming a Challenge Into a Habit
-------------------------------------

The Second Edition of the **12 Week AWS Workshops Challenge**, organized by Paula Ali Wakabi, wasn’t just another training series. For me, it became a structured launchpad, not only for learning cloud fundamentals, but for _finally_ building a sustainable, focused **habit** around Cloud Engineering & Development.

This time around, I decided to approach each week differently. Instead of just watching sessions and copying steps, I wrote question-based reflections during and after every webinar. This shift in how I consumed and retained information didn’t just make the concepts stick it actually **helped me pass my AWS Solutions Architect exam.**

Why? Because those exam questions?
They **actually make sense** once you’ve configured IAM permissions incorrectly, had a Lambda timeout at midnight, or stared at your CloudWatch logs for answers like they were horoscopes.

But the real transformation happened after the final project.

The Capstone Changed Everything
-------------------------------

Building the [**CloudPulse**](http://cloudpulse-frontend.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/) task management app brought everything together: Compute, Storage, Databases, Networking, Security, Cost Management, Monitoring, even the _Well Architected Framework_ itself.

It was no longer just AWS Documentation and Blogs.
It was **real**:

Mistakes made.

Problems solved.

Things broken and fixed .

And that’s exactly how Cloud Engineering and Web Development is in real life.

I didn’t just build a serverless app.
I built **momentum**.

The Saturday Habit
------------------

Somewhere between Writing Code and Writing Blog Posts, I made a decision:
Every **Saturday, 09h00 to 15h00**, is _blocked off_ for this work.

Period.
Whether I post or not, that’s the window for Building, Learning, Documenting, and Engaging with the AWS community.

Not a “try-to-fit-it-in” time.
Not a “when I feel inspired” time.
A **non-negotiable window.**

I don’t know exactly how this will evolve in 2026, but I _do_ know this:
Building in public **_works._**

Writing every week **_works._**

Showing up consistently **_works._**

And showing up when you _don’t feel like it_? That’s where the real growth starts.

Why It Matters
--------------

The AWS ecosystem is huge.

Overwhelming.

Ever-changing.

It’s easy to consume content endlessly and feel like you’re learning.
But unless you _do something with it,_

unless you make, break, rebuild, and teach

it doesn’t stick.

That’s what this challenge gave me:
Not just knowledge.
Not just a portfolio.
But a **practice**.

So, shoutout to the 2025 Challenge, the AWS Community, and everyone who shared their questions, mistakes, and successes. Let’s see where this habit takes us in 2026.
