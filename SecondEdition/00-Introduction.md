# Leverage the AWS Community to Gain Cloud Skills

## The 12-Week AWS Workshop Challenge by Paula Wakabi
--------------------------------------------------

The AWS User Group Yaoundé (YDE) in partnership with Women in Cloud Africa (WICA) launched the 2025 edition of the #12WeekAWSWorkshopChallenge, organized by Paula Ali Wakabi – widely recognized in the cloud community as Miss Cloud.

This isn’t just another workshop series, it’s a transformative 12-week journey that combines hands-on AWS skills development with technical writing and community building, positioning you for success in both Cloud Engineering and the AWS Community Ecosystem of Builders.

The 12 Weeks AWS Workshop Challenge
-----------------------------------

Over 12 intensive weeks, you’ll participate in weekly live sessions, tackle real-world labs, and publish an article documenting each learning milestone.

The challenge operates on three pillars: **build** practical cloud solutions, **document** your technical journey, and **connect** with fellow cloud enthusiasts across Africa and beyond.

While sessions are recorded for flexibility, the magic happens when you engage live – asking questions in real time, troubleshooting alongside peers, and sharing breakthrough moments.

How the The 12 Weeks AWS Workshop Challenge Works
-------------------------------------------------

### Live Interactive Sessions

Work through AWS Workshops with expert guidance and real-time support

### Community-Powered Learning

An active Discord Channel where you can collaborate, debug, and learn from practitioners at all levels, from beginner to advanced!

### Practical Documentation

Write and publish a blog post after each session to cement your learning and build your technical portfolio.

### Flexible Catch-Up

Can’t attend live?

Recorded sessions and async community support ensure you stay on track.

Your Direct Path to the AWS Community Builders Program
------------------------------------------------------

Here’s the _strategic advantage_ most participants miss: **your weekly articles become your AWS Community Builders application portfolio.**

The AWS Community Builders program seeks contributors who consistently create high-quality technical content and genuinely help others learn.

Twelve well-crafted articles, published over twelve consecutive weeks, provide irrefutable evidence of both your technical depth and your commitment to community impact.

Transforming Challenge Articles into a Winning Application
----------------------------------------------------------

### Document hands-on implementation, not just theory

1.  Share the actual solutions you built, complete with code snippets, GitHub repositories, and architecture diagrams.
2.  Include screenshots of working deployments, templates, or configurations.
3.  Demonstrate applied knowledge, not just conceptual understanding.

### Explain your engineering reasoning

1.  Why did you select this particular AWS service over alternatives?
2.  What cost, security, and performance tradeoffs did you evaluate?
3.  How would your solution scale or adapt to different requirements?
4.  What production considerations did you account for?

### Teach through transparency

1.  Provide step-by-step implementation guides that others can follow
2.  Document errors you encountered and exactly how you resolved them
3.  Share the debugging process – this demonstrates real expertise
4.  Include lessons learned and what you’d do differently next time

### Prove consistency and growth

1.  Twelve posts over twelve weeks show dedication and follow-through
2.  Cross-post to multiple platforms (Hashnode, Dev.to, Medium, LinkedIn) to maximize reach
3.  Show progression in complexity and depth as you advance through topics

### Highlight community engagement

1.  Reference discussions from Discord, office hours, or study groups
2.  Acknowledge community members who helped you or whose work inspired you
3.  Share how peer feedback improved your implementations
4.  Demonstrate your role as both learner and teacher

### Create a compelling portfolio package

1.  Build a landing page linking all 12 articles with brief summaries
2.  Include GitHub repositories with clean README files
3.  Add architecture diagrams and demo videos where applicable
4.  Quantify outcomes: “Built X, learned Y, helped Z community members”

Leveraging the AWS Community for Accelerated Growth
---------------------------------------------------

### Hands-on Skills That Stick

1.  **Real-world scenarios**: Weekly labs mirror actual cloud engineering challenges, building muscle memory that serves you in interviews and on the job.
2.  **Safe experimentation**: AWS sandbox access lets you break things, test hypotheses, and learn without cost concerns.
3.  **Progressive complexity**: Topics build logically, allowing you to construct increasingly sophisticated solutions.

### Rapid Problem Resolution

1.  **Expert access**: Discord channels connect you directly to AWS professionals, Community Builders, and experienced practitioners
2.  **Peer learning**: Often, fellow participants have just solved the problem you’re facing – shared struggles create shared solutions.
3.  **Diverse perspectives**: Community members bring different backgrounds, use cases, and approaches to every technical challenge

### Collaboration Opportunities

1.  **Study Buddies**: Form small groups for accountability, joint labs, and peer code reviews
2.  **Content review partnerships**: Trade article drafts with other participants to improve technical accuracy and clarity
3.  **Project teams**: Some of the best learning comes from building something together – use the community to find collaborators

### Strategic Networking

1.  **Geographic diversity**: Connect with builders across Africa and globally, expanding your professional reach
2.  **Multiple expertise levels:** Learn from seniors while mentoring beginners – both strengthen your understanding
3.  **Career opportunities**: These connections frequently lead to speaking invitations, job referrals, open-source contributions, and consulting opportunities
4.  **Long-term relationships:** Your 12-week cohort often becomes a lasting professional network

Maximizing Your 12-Week Investment
----------------------------------

### Schedule Strategically

1.  Add all sessions to your calendar immediately and protect that time
2.  Treat this like a commitment you’ve made to your future self
3.  Aim for live attendance, but don’t let a missed session derail you – catch up via recordings

### Build A Sustainable Writing Habit

1.  Publish every week, even if some posts are shorter than others
2.  Set a writing schedule (e.g., every Sunday evening after the week’s lab)
3.  Use templates to streamline the process while maintaining quality
4.  **Remember:** consistent “good enough” beats occasional “perfect”

### Track And Showcase Your Impact

1.  Monitor article views, comments, shares, and GitHub stars
2.  Screenshot meaningful feedback and engagement
3.  Document how your content helped others (DMs, comments thanking you, etc.)

### Amplify Your Visibility

1.  Share each article in the Discord community channel
2.  Post on LinkedIn, Twitter/X, and other social platforms
3.  Use consistent hashtags: #12WeekAWSWorkshopChallenge, #AWS, #CloudComputing, #AWSCommunityBuilders
4.  Tag Paula Ali Wakabi and AWS User Group Yaoundé to increase discoverability
5.  Engage with others’ posts – community is reciprocal
