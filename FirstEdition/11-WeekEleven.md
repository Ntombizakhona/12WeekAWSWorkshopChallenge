# AI Coding Companion

When you think of a ‘coding companion’ you probably assume you need to find a friend in real life, who also happens to be a human being, to code with you in case coding gets monotonous. Well, using that analogy, an AI coding companion in the cloud computing world is a ‘tech friend’ that will help you enhance your productivity and efficiency by either using simple prompts using comments, or it just analyzes your code, while you’re coding, to give you better code.

On AWS, you can leverage Amazon CodeWhisperer as your AI Coding Companion.

Introduction to Amazon CodeWhisperer
------------------------------------

Amazon CodeWhispherer is an AI powered coding companion service, trained on **billions** of lines of code. It provides real time coding recommendations — while you code. These recommendations can be generated based on your comments that are written in Natural Language (English) or based on your existing code written in a Programming Language.

The generated code can come in functions and blocks, based on your programming style. You can accept the suggestion by CodeWhisperer or you can continue with your own code.

Therefore, instead of heading over to StackOverFlow, ChatGPT or your browser to look for sample coding solutions and suggestions to optimize your code, CodeWhisperer speedily provides it for you in your IDE. You don’t have to open multiple tabs, and switch back and forth from your IDE to your browser because CodeWhisperer abstracts and simplifies this timeous process for you.

You can use Amazon CodeWhisperer on your IDE (if its supported), AWS Lambda or AWS Cloud9.

### Amazon CodeWhisperer Tiers
