The AWS User Group Yaoundé (YDE) led by AWS Community Builders Paula Ali Wakabi ft Chi Che, started a #12WeekAWSWorkshopChallenge on the 7th of October 2023 which will end on the 23rd of December. You know what this means? It means that we will be getting enhanced knowledge and more skills for the holidays, and enter 2024 with more confidence in our Cloud Skills. A perfect 12 Weeks if you ask me!

After each video, we are encouraged to write a blog post in order to improve or develop Content Creation, Technical Writing Skills, and Documentation… so that’s what I’m doing.

Writing.
Documenting.
Creating Content.

They have just concluded Week 7 on Saturday, the 18th of November 2023, which means that I certainly have some catching up to do! I can’t wait to embark & continue with this AWSome Challenge. Thankfully, the sessions are recorded, just in case you can’t make it, but make sure to clear your calendar either way, because this rewarding experience, will have…rewards.

According to Chi Che:
So, how does it work? 🤔
🔴 Each week, the 15 most engaged participants will gain access to Whizlabs labs and the AWS sandbox for a generous 6-month period.

🔴 And for the top 10 winners at the end of these thrilling 12 weeks? They’ll earn themselves the coveted Whizlabs premium subscription for a full 2 years!
If that doesn’t motivate you to participate in this Challenge, then I don’t know what will.

You can join their Discord Channel which also includes the recordings of previous weeks, as well as other participants and experts that you can learn from…

# Creating an AWS Personal Account
Well, first things, first. I hope to create introductory posts, based on the topic presented each week, and since this is an AWS Challenge, and it includes hands on experience, you will obviously need to create an AWS Account, if you don’t have one already.

Do you have an AWS Account?
**Yes?** Well, that’s cool, see you in my next post then.
*No?* Ok, no big deal, let’s create it quickly. Your first hands-on experience with AWS. Exciting times ahead.

## Prerequisites
To create an AWS Account you will need:
(1) an administrative email account,
(2) and a valid payment method.

By administrative email account, I don’t mean a domain email account necessarily, just an email account that you have permanent access to, which belongs to you. This email account will come in handy when you need to recover your account or for certain administrative tasks.

*Okay! Let’s Build…*
