# 12 Weeks AWS Workshop Challenge

This repository tracks my **12-week AWS workshop challenge** a structured learning sprint where I build consistently, document what I learn, and turn theory into hands-on cloud skills.

The goal is simple show up every week, complete workshops, and leave behind proof of work I can reference later.

## Purpose

## What You’ll Find in This Repo
